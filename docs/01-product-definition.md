# Product Definition - Simple Kanban Board

## Core Problem
Need a simple, efficient way to track project work and task progress without vendor lock-in or licensing concerns.

## Solution
Web-based kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality that you fully own and control.

## Target Users
- Individual developers and small teams
- Users who want to avoid vendor dependency risk
- Teams needing customizable workflow tools

## Success Metrics
- Tasks can be created, moved, and completed intuitively
- Board state persists between sessions
- Fast, responsive interface
- Easy to modify and customize for specific workflows

## Initial Scope
- Three columns: To Do, In Progress, Done
- Create/edit/delete tasks with timestamps
- Drag-and-drop between columns
- Task persistence (PostgreSQL database)
- Task aging metrics (days open)
- Board management (create/edit/delete boards)
- Simple, clean UI with modern styling
- Single container deployment

## Current Status - MVP COMPLETE âœ…
- âœ… Core kanban functionality implemented and tested
- âœ… Task timestamps and aging display with color-coded indicators
- âœ… Board management features (create, edit, delete, select)
- âœ… PostgreSQL persistence with proper data relationships
- âœ… Containerized deployment with Kubernetes/Helm
- âœ… Drag-and-drop functionality with persistence
- âœ… Board selection persistence across page refreshes
- âœ… Responsive web interface with modern UI
- ðŸ“‹ Multi-user authentication (planned for Phase 2)
- ðŸ“‹ Advanced features (export, keyboard shortcuts, etc.)

## MVP Completion - DELIVERED
The initial MVP has been successfully completed and tested with all core features:
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Complete create, read, update, delete for boards, columns, and tasks
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Tasks can be moved between columns with full persistence
- **Task Aging**: Visual indicators showing "days open" with color coding (blue=new, green=fresh, orange=aging, red=stale)
- **Board Management**: Multiple boards with persistent selection across sessions
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with animations and professional styling
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete Kubernetes deployment with PostgreSQL backend
- **Data Persistence**: All changes persist correctly across page refreshes and restarts
- Simple, clean UI with modern styling
- Single container deployment

## Constraints
- Containerized deployment following security patterns
- Single-user initially (multi-user expansion later)
- Web-based (no mobile app needed initially)
- Self-contained with no external dependencies

## Key Requirements from User
- **Full Ownership**: No licensing or vendor control issues
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify for specific workflows
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete control over data and deployment
- **Simple**: Focus on core kanban functionality without bloat

description: Process for creating effective user stories
---

Follow this methodology to create clear, valuable user stories:

1. Identify stakeholders and personas
   - Define key user roles and personas
   - Understand their goals and motivations
   - Consider different user skill levels
   - Map personas to business objectives

2. Conduct user journey mapping
   - Trace end-to-end user interactions
   - Identify pain points and opportunities
   - Document current workflows and processes
   - Visualize ideal user experiences

3. Draft user stories
   - Use the format: "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
   - Focus on user value, not implementation details
   - Ensure stories are independent when possible
   - Keep stories small and focused

4. Define acceptance criteria
   - Create clear, testable conditions for completion
   - Use "Given-When-Then" format for clarity
   - Include both happy path and edge cases
   - Consider performance and usability criteria

5. Prioritize stories
   - Assess business value of each story
   - Consider technical dependencies
   - Evaluate implementation complexity
   - Balance quick wins with strategic needs

6. Refine and estimate
   - Review stories with the development team
   - Break down larger stories if needed
   - Assign relative effort estimates
   - Clarify any ambiguities or assumptions

# Feature Planning - Simple Kanban Board

## Project Scope Review

### Core Deliverables
- **Self-hosted kanban board** with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Three-column workflow**: To Do, In Progress, Done
- **Task management**: Create, edit, delete, move tasks
- **Data persistence** with PostgreSQL backend
- **Single-container deployment** with Docker
- **Story planning integration** capabilities

### Critical Path Components
1. **Backend API** (FastAPI with SQLAlchemy)
2. **Frontend UI** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript with drag-and-drop)
3. **Database schema** (PostgreSQL with migrations)
4. **Container deployment** (Docker + Helm charts)
5. **Authentication system** (JWT-based)

### Technical Dependencies
- Database must be established before API endpoints
- API must be functional before frontend integration
- Authentication required for multi-user features
- SOPS secrets management for production deployment

## Milestone Breakdown

### Milestone 1: Foundation & Core Backend (Week 1-2)
**Objective**: Establish backend infrastructure and basic API

**Deliverables:**
- Database schema and migrations
- FastAPI application structure
- Core API endpoints (CRUD operations)
- Authentication system
- Docker containerization
- Basic health checks and monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Database schema supports tasks with columns
- ✅ API endpoints for task operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ JWT authentication working
- ✅ Container runs with non-root user (1000:1000)
- ✅ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- ✅ All tests passing with >90% coverage

**User Stories Covered:** US-003, US-006, US-011

### Milestone 4: Deployment & Configuration (Week 6)
**Objective**: Production-ready deployment with customization options

**Deliverables:**
- Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
- Environment-based configuration
- SOPS-encrypted secrets management
- Documentation and deployment guides
- Monitoring and logging setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Single `docker run` command works
- ✅ Helm chart deploys successfully
- ✅ Environment variables configure behavior

### Milestone 5: Enhancement & Future Features (Week 7+)
**Objective**: Advanced features and story planning integration

**Deliverables:**
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Story planning API integration
- Advanced theming options
- Multi-user support foundation
- Performance monitoring dashboard

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts work as specified
- ✅ Story planning endpoints functional
- ✅ CSS variables enable easy theming
- ✅ User management system ready
- ✅ Performance dashboard shows metrics

**User Stories Covered:** US-012, Story Planning Features

## Development Sequence

### Phase 1: MVP (Milestones 1-3)
**Duration**: 5 weeks
**Goal**: Fully functional single-user kanban board

**Parallel Work Opportunities:**
- Frontend development can start once API contracts are defined
- Docker configuration can be developed alongside backend
- Documentation can be written as features are completed

### Phase 2: Production Ready (Milestone 4)
**Duration**: 1 week
**Goal**: Deployable, configurable, secure application

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Milestone 5)
**Duration**: Ongoing
**Goal**: Enhanced user experience and story planning integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database migration complexity**: Use Alembic for versioned migrations
- **Drag-and-drop browser compatibility**: Test across major browsers
- **Performance with large datasets**: Implement pagination and lazy loading
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular dependency updates and security scans

### Schedule Risks
- **Scope creep**: Strict adherence to milestone acceptance criteria
- **Integration challenges**: Early API contract definition and testing
- **Deployment complexity**: Use established patterns from stormpath project

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% for backend, 80% for frontend
- **Linting**: Black, Ruff, Pyright must pass
- **Security**: Bandit and Checkov scans must pass
- **Performance**: API responses under 100ms, page load under 2s

### Review Process
- **Feature branches**: All work in feature branches with PR reviews
- **Milestone reviews**: Demo and acceptance criteria verification
- **Security review**: Before production deployment
- **Performance testing**: Load testing before milestone completion

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- All user stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Performance targets achieved
- Security scan compliance

### Business Metrics
- Single-container deployment working
- Complete ownership and customization capability
- Documentation sufficient for team adoption
- Foundation ready for story planning integration

## Next Steps

1. **Initialize development environment** with database and API structure
2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing and deployment
3. **Begin Milestone 1 development** focusing on backend foundation
4. **Establish review and testing processes** for quality assurance

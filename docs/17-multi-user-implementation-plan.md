# Multi-User Implementation Plan - Simple Kanban Board

## Phase Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding multi-user authentication and authorization to the Simple Kanban Board application.

## Phase 1: User Management Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Create `users` table with Google OIDC integration fields
- [ ] Create `user_sessions` table for JWT token management
- [ ] Add `user_id` foreign key to `boards` table
- [ ] Create database migration scripts

### Authentication Infrastructure
- [ ] Install and configure Google OIDC dependencies (`python-jose`, `google-auth`)
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Create authentication middleware for FastAPI
- [ ] Add Google OAuth callback endpoint
- [ ] Implement user registration/login flow

### User Profile Management
- [ ] Create user profile API endpoints (CRUD)
- [ ] Implement user preferences storage
- [ ] Add user avatar handling from Google
- [ ] Create user dashboard endpoint

## Phase 2: Board Ownership (Week 3)

### Backend Changes
- [ ] Update board creation to assign ownership
- [ ] Modify board listing to filter by user access
- [ ] Add board ownership validation middleware
- [ ] Update all board operations to check ownership

### API Security
- [ ] Add authentication requirements to all board endpoints
- [ ] Implement user context injection
- [ ] Add rate limiting per user
- [ ] Update API documentation with auth requirements

### Data Migration
- [ ] Create migration script for existing boards
- [ ] Assign existing boards to default admin user
- [ ] Test migration with backup data

## Phase 3: Collaboration & Permissions (Week 4-5)

### RBAC Implementation
- [ ] Create `board_memberships` table
- [ ] Implement role-based permission decorators
- [ ] Add board invitation system
- [ ] Create member management API endpoints

### Frontend Authentication
- [ ] Add Google Sign-In button to UI
- [ ] Implement authentication state management
- [ ] Add user profile display
- [ ] Create login/logout functionality

### Board Sharing UI
- [ ] Add "Share Board" modal
- [ ] Implement member invitation interface
- [ ] Add role selection (Owner/Editor/Viewer)
- [ ] Display current board members

## Phase 4: Enhanced Multi-User Features (Week 6)

### Advanced Permissions
- [ ] Implement granular task permissions
- [ ] Add board transfer functionality
- [ ] Create team/organization support
- [ ] Add bulk member management

### User Experience
- [ ] Add user dashboard with accessible boards
- [ ] Implement board filtering and search
- [ ] Add recent boards functionality
- [ ] Create notification system for invitations

### Admin Interface
- [ ] Create system admin role
- [ ] Add user management interface
- [ ] Implement usage analytics
- [ ] Add audit trail functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies to Add
```python
# requirements.txt additions
python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0
google-auth==2.23.3
google-auth-oauthlib==1.1.0
python-multipart==0.0.6
passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# New environment variables
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/auth/callback
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_EXPIRATION_HOURS=24
ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION=true
```

### API Endpoint Changes
- All existing endpoints will require authentication
- New endpoints: `/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/logout`
- User endpoints: `/api/users/me`, `/api/users/preferences`
- Board sharing: `/api/boards/{id}/members`, `/api/boards/{id}/invite`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Authentication middleware tests
- [ ] Permission decorator tests
- [ ] User management API tests
- [ ] Board ownership validation tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Google OIDC flow testing
- [ ] Multi-user board access scenarios
- [ ] Permission inheritance testing
- [ ] Session management testing

### Migration Testing
- [ ] Test data migration scripts
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Performance impact assessment

## Deployment Considerations

### Security Updates
- [ ] Update Kubernetes security contexts
- [ ] Add secrets management for OAuth credentials
- [ ] Implement HTTPS requirements
- [ ] Add CSRF protection

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add authentication metrics
- [ ] Implement user activity logging
- [ ] Create permission audit trails
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for auth flows

### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Update backup procedures for user data
- [ ] Test user data recovery scenarios
- [ ] Implement GDPR compliance features
- [ ] Add data export functionality

## Risk Mitigation

### Backward Compatibility
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Fallback to single-user mode if needed
- Migration rollback procedures
- Comprehensive testing before deployment

### Security Considerations
- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing for auth flows
- OAuth token security best practices
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Performance Impact
- Database indexing for user queries
- Caching strategies for permissions
- Load testing with multiple users
- Optimization of auth middleware

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- Users can authenticate with Google
- User profiles are created and managed
- Basic session management works

### Phase 2 Success
- Board ownership is enforced
- Users see only their accessible boards
- Existing data is migrated successfully

### Phase 3 Success
- Board sharing works end-to-end
- Role-based permissions are enforced
- UI supports multi-user workflows

### Phase 4 Success
- Advanced features enhance collaboration
- Admin interface provides system control
- Performance meets requirements with multiple users

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Advanced Teams**: Organization and team management
3. **Integration APIs**: Third-party integrations (Slack, email, etc.)
4. **Mobile Support**: Progressive Web App or native mobile apps
5. **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior and board usage analytics

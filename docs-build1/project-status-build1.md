### Enhanced Development Workflow
```makefile
# Key development commands
make setup              # Initialize development environment
make secrets-gen        # Generate encrypted secrets with SOPS
make dev               # Start development with Skaffold
make dev-monitoring    # Start development with full monitoring stack
make monitoring-up     # Start Prometheus + Grafana + AlertManager
make test              # Run comprehensive test suite
make lint              # Code quality and security checks
make deploy            # Deploy to Kubernetes with Helm
make fix-black       # Auto-fix Black formatting
make fix-ruff        # Auto-fix Ruff issues
make secrets-edit    # Edit encrypted secrets with SOPS
make secrets-k8s-apply # Deploy secrets to Kubernetes
```

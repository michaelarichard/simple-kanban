# Build 1 - Development Tracking

## Overview

This directory tracks the progress, status, and story completion for **Build 1** of the Simple Kanban Board project on the `kanban-main1` branch.

## Purpose

- **Separate tracking** from baseline planning documents
- **Preserve baseline** for future build attempts
- **Track actual progress** vs planned milestones
- **Document lessons learned** for Build 1 approach

## Build 1 Strategy

**Development Approach**: Full-stack parallel development with observability-first implementation
**Target Timeline**: 6 weeks across 5 milestones
**Focus Areas**: 
- Complete observability integration from day one
- PostgreSQL + Redis architecture
- Container-first development
- Production-ready deployment

## Files in this Directory

### Progress Tracking
- `project-status-build1.md` - Current status and completed phases
- `development-stories-build1.md` - Story breakdown with completion tracking
- `feature-planning-build1.md` - Milestone progress and acceptance criteria

### Build 1 Specific Documentation
- `lessons-learned-build1.md` - What worked, what didn't, improvements for Build 2
- `technical-decisions-build1.md` - Build-specific architecture choices
- `sprint-retrospectives-build1.md` - Sprint-by-sprint learnings

## Relationship to Baseline

**Baseline Planning** (preserved in `docs/` and `planning-baseline` branch):
- Original user stories and requirements
- Architecture options and decisions
- Initial planning and research
- Template configurations

**Build 1 Tracking** (this directory):
- Actual implementation progress
- Story completion status
- Real-world timeline adjustments
- Technical debt and issues encountered

## Usage

### During Development
1. Update story completion in `development-stories-build1.md`
2. Track milestone progress in `project-status-build1.md`
3. Document decisions in `technical-decisions-build1.md`
4. Record retrospective notes in `sprint-retrospectives-build1.md`

### After Build 1 Completion
1. Complete `lessons-learned-build1.md` with full analysis
2. Archive this directory as historical reference
3. Use learnings to inform Build 2 planning
4. Compare actual vs planned outcomes

## Success Metrics for Build 1

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] All 12 Milestone 1 stories completed
- [ ] Observability fully functional (OpenTelemetry + local monitoring)
- [ ] Container deployment working
- [ ] Test coverage >90%
- [ ] Security scans passing

### Process Metrics
- [ ] Sprint velocity consistent with estimates
- [ ] Story breakdown accuracy
- [ ] Development workflow efficiency
- [ ] Documentation completeness

### Learning Metrics
- [ ] Clear identification of what worked well
- [ ] Documented challenges and solutions
- [ ] Recommendations for Build 2
- [ ] Team collaboration effectiveness

This approach ensures we can experiment with Build 1 while preserving the ability to start fresh with Build 2 using refined planning based on real-world learnings.

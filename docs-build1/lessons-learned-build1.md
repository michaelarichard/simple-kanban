# Build 1 - Lessons Learned

## Overview
This document captures lessons learned during Build 1 development on the `kanban-main1` branch.

## Development Approach: Full-Stack Parallel with Observability-First

### What We're Testing
- **Observability-first development**: Implementing OpenTelemetry and monitoring from day one
- **Full-stack parallel**: Frontend and backend development simultaneously
- **Container-first**: Docker development environment from start
- **Production-ready from start**: Helm charts, secrets management, CI/CD

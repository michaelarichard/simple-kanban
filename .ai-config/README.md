# AI Configuration

This directory contains configuration settings for the AI assistant to help maintain consistent development practices.

## Overview

The configuration is organized into two main components:

- **Development Standards**: Guidelines that define coding style and quality expectations
- **Process Templates**: Step-by-step guides for common development activities

## Structure

```
.ai-config/
├── standards/
│   └── development-guidelines.md
├── processes/
│   ├── new-feature.md
│   ├── quality-assessment.md
│   ├── troubleshooting.md
│   ├── design-evaluation.md
│   ├── project-design.md
│   ├── architecture-design.md
│   ├── milestone-planning.md
│   └── user-story-creation.md
└── README.md
```

## Using Process Templates

During conversations with the AI assistant, you can reference these templates:

- `/new-feature`: Guide for implementing features
- `/quality-assessment`: Framework for code review
- `/troubleshooting`: Methodology for resolving issues
- `/design-evaluation`: System architecture assessment
- `/project-design`: Process for designing a new project
- `/architecture-design`: Process for creating system architecture
- `/milestone-planning`: Process for breaking projects into milestones
- `/user-story-creation`: Process for creating effective user stories

## Customization

These configuration files can be modified to match your team's specific practices and requirements.

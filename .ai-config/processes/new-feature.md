When implementing a new feature:

1. Create a feature branch from the main branch
2. Write acceptance criteria and test cases first
3. Implement minimal code to pass tests
4. Refactor for clarity and performance
5. Add comprehensive documentation
6. Verify all tests pass locally
7. Submit pull request with detailed description
8. Address review feedback promptly
9. Merge only after all checks pass

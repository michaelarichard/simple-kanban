# Development Story Breakdown Process

Follow this workflow to convert milestone deliverables into actionable development stories:

## 1. Review Milestone Scope
- Examine milestone deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Identify technical components and dependencies
- Consider integration points and testing requirements
- Review user stories that map to this milestone

## 2. Identify Development Stories
Break each deliverable into granular development tasks:
- **Database stories**: Schema, migrations, models
- **API stories**: Endpoints, validation, error handling
- **Frontend stories**: Components, interactions, styling
- **Infrastructure stories**: Docker, deployment, monitoring
- **Testing stories**: Unit tests, integration tests, documentation

## 3. Define Story Structure
Each development story should include:
- **Story ID**: Unique identifier (DEV-001, DEV-002, etc.)
- **Title**: Clear, action-oriented description
- **Description**: What needs to be built and why
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable requirements
- **Dependencies**: Other stories that must be completed first
- **Estimate**: Story points or time estimate
- **Definition of Done**: Quality gates and completion criteria

## 4. Story Template Format
```markdown
### DEV-XXX: [Story Title]
**Epic**: [Milestone Name]
**Type**: [Database/API/Frontend/Infrastructure/Testing]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Estimate**: [Story Points/Hours]

**Description:**
As a [developer/user], I need [functionality] so that [business value].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1 with specific measurable outcome
- [ ] Criterion 2 with verification method
- [ ] Criterion 3 with quality requirement

**Dependencies:**
- DEV-XXX: [Dependency description]

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security scan passing
- [ ] Performance requirements met

**Technical Notes:**
- Implementation approach
- Key design decisions
- Potential risks or challenges
```

## 5. Prioritize and Sequence Stories
- **Critical path**: Stories that block other work
- **Dependencies**: Ensure proper ordering
- **Risk**: High-risk stories early for validation
- **Value**: Business value and user impact
- **Complexity**: Balance simple and complex stories

## 6. Validate Story Breakdown
Ensure stories are:
- **Independent**: Can be developed separately
- **Negotiable**: Details can be refined during development
- **Valuable**: Delivers measurable progress
- **Estimable**: Complexity can be assessed
- **Small**: Completable within 1-3 days
- **Testable**: Clear verification criteria

## 7. Create Development Backlog
- **Sprint-ready stories**: Detailed and estimated
- **Backlog grooming**: Regular refinement sessions
- **Story mapping**: Visual organization of work
- **Milestone tracking**: Progress toward deliverables

## 8. Document Story Breakdown
Create comprehensive documentation:
- **Story list**: All stories with metadata
- **Dependency graph**: Visual representation of dependencies
- **Sprint planning**: Story allocation to development cycles
- **Progress tracking**: Completion status and metrics

## Quality Gates

### Story Completeness
- All acceptance criteria defined
- Dependencies identified
- Estimates provided
- Definition of done specified

### Technical Readiness
- Architecture decisions documented
- API contracts defined
- Database schema planned
- Testing strategy outlined

### Team Alignment
- Stories reviewed by team
- Estimates validated
- Dependencies confirmed
- Risks identified and mitigated

## Tools and Templates

### Story Management
- Use consistent story IDs and naming
- Maintain traceability to user stories and milestones
- Track progress with clear status indicators
- Document decisions and changes

### Documentation
- Keep story breakdown in version control
- Update as requirements evolve
- Link to related architecture and design docs
- Maintain changelog of story modifications

description: Process for creating system architecture
---

Follow this methodology for developing system architecture:

1. Analyze requirements and constraints
   - Review functional and non-functional requirements
   - Identify technical constraints and limitations
   - Consider scalability, performance, and security needs
   - Understand integration points with external systems

2. Select architectural patterns
   - Evaluate appropriate architectural styles (microservices, monolithic, etc.)
   - Consider design patterns for recurring problems
   - Assess trade-offs between different approaches
   - Choose patterns that align with project requirements

3. Design component structure
   - Define major system components and their responsibilities
   - Establish component interfaces and contracts
   - Document component dependencies and relationships
   - Ensure separation of concerns and modularity

4. Create data architecture
   - Design data models and schemas
   - Select appropriate data storage solutions
   - Define data flow and transformation processes
   - Plan for data integrity and consistency

5. Address cross-cutting concerns
   - Design authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Plan for logging, monitoring, and observability
   - Develop error handling and resilience strategies
   - Consider deployment and DevOps requirements

6. Document architecture decisions
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
   - Diagram system components and interactions
   - Document rationale for key decisions
   - Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

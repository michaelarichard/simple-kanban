# PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER Documentation

This directory contains project documentation and workflow references.

## Project Workflows

The following workflow documents are copied from the global `.ai-config` system to provide local reference:

- `workflows/` - Complete workflow documentation
- `standards/` - Development standards and guidelines
- `processes/` - Step-by-step process documentation

## Usage

These workflows can be referenced during development:

1. **Planning Phase**: Use idea-to-project workflow
2. **Development**: Follow new-feature and code-review processes
3. **Architecture**: Reference architecture-design guidelines
4. **Quality**: Apply development-guidelines standards

## Local Customization

You can customize these workflows for project-specific needs while maintaining consistency with global standards.
